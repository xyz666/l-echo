# Intro #

1.0 is still a long ways away.  Here's how we're (which currently only involves myself) gonna get there.

# Future Releases #

  * 0.3 - character model - likely to be hard coded
  * 0.3.1 - (post-mortem) forgot to change the goals to be one of those shadow mannequins, started packing in reverse-engineered stages (oh, and I added the second solution to A1)
  * 0.3.2 - fix launch parabola - speed of the character and a more smooth transition between the character's arc to a platform and to...nowhere.
  * 0.3.3 - change the character's speed so the character walks at the same pace no matter, the distance of the grids; also, add running.


  * 0.4 - walking animation
  * 0.4.1 - walking on stairs animation
  * 0.4.2 - UPDATED: NEWNewHolesAndLaunchers
  * 0.4.3 - falling animation
  * 0.4.4 - landing animation

  * 0.5 - level creator...

  * 0.6 - audio

  * 0.7 to 1.0 - stages, stages, stages! And maybe more modes (fighting mode?)
